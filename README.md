# TechnicalTest
ABOUT
This is a WPF solution to for the Technical Test. The application contains a single form and a small database containing two tables.


INSTALLATION





HOW TO USE
The required data for the test shoud already by in the associated mdf database. If, for some reason, this is not there, you have the options

- Populate it via code by clicking on Pop.Types and Pop.Inventory. After pressing these buttons, the listview below the buttons should now be populated.
- Entering the data manually via Add button and the data entry panel at the bottom of the form. If you choose to enter the data manually, you will still need to click on the Pop.Types button as this produces the data for the combobox in the data entry panel.

To run the updates required in the Technical Test, click on the button called Progress at left of the Red Bar at the top of the form.
